The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world." The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism. The painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.

The painting's global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism—a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arsène Lupin), and the song "Mona Lisa" recorded by Nat King Cole—one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.

The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US\$100 million in 1962, equivalent to \$1 billion as of 2023.

The Last Supper (Italian: Il Cenacolo or L'Ultima Cena) is a mural painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to c. 1495–1498, housed in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with the Twelve Apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John – specifically the moment after Jesus announces that one of his apostles will betray him. Its handling of space, mastery of perspective, treatment of motion and complex display of human emotion has made it one of the Western world's most recognizable paintings and among Leonardo's most celebrated works. Some commentators consider it pivotal in inaugurating the transition into what is now termed the High Renaissance.

The work was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. In order to permit his inconsistent painting schedule and frequent revisions, it is painted with materials that allowed for regular alterations: tempera on gesso, pitch, and mastic. Due to the methods used, a variety of environmental factors, and intentional damage, little of the original painting remains today despite numerous restoration attempts, the last being completed in 1999. The Last Supper is Leonardo's largest work, aside from the Sala delle Asse.

      "artworkDetails": """
The Creation of Adam is a fresco painting by Michelangelo, which forms part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling, painted circa 1508–1512. It illustrates the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God gives life to Adam, the first man. The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of humanity itself and is one of the most replicated religious paintings of all time. The fresco is renowned for its beauty, composition, and the profound symbolism of the act of creation.

In 1505, Michelangelo was invited back to Rome by the newly elected Pope Julius II and was commissioned to build the Pope's tomb, which was to include forty statues and be finished in five years. Under the patronage of the Pope, Michelangelo experienced constant interruptions to his work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks. Although Michelangelo worked on the tomb for 40 years, it was never finished to his satisfaction. It is located in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli in Rome and is most famous for his central figure of Moses, completed in 1516. Of the other statues intended for the tomb, two known as the Heroic Captive (Rebellious Slave) and the Dying Captive (Dying Slave), are now in the Louvre.

During the same period, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which took approximately four years to complete (1508–1512). According to accounts, Bramante, who was working on the building of St Peter's Basilica, resented Michelangelo's commission for the Pope's tomb and convinced the Pope to commission him in a medium with which he was unfamiliar, in order that he might fail at the task.

Michelangelo was originally commissioned to paint the Twelve Apostles on the triangular pendentives that supported the ceiling, and cover the central part of the ceiling with ornament. Michelangelo persuaded Pope Julius to give him a free hand and proposed a different and more complex scheme, representing the Creation, the Fall of Man, the Promise of Salvation through the prophets, and the genealogy of Christ. The work is part of a larger scheme of decoration within the chapel which represents much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church.

The composition stretches over 45 ft. × 128 ft. (more than 500 square metres) of ceiling, and contains over 300 figures. At its centre are nine episodes from the Book of Genesis, divided into three groups: God's creation of the world; God's creation of man and his fall from God's grace; and lastly, the state of humanity and sin as represented by Noah and his family. On the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of Jesus; seven prophets of Israel and five Sibyls, prophetic women of the Classical world. Among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are The Creation of Adam, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, the Deluge, the Prophet Jeremiah and the Cumaean Sibyl.

      "artworkDetails": """
The Birth of Venus (Italian: Nascita di Venere) is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid-1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown. The painting is housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.

Although not a pair, The Birth of Venus is often discussed alongside Botticelli's other large mythological painting, Primavera, also in the Uffizi. Both are icons of Italian Renaissance painting and among the most famous paintings in the world, with The Birth of Venus being the better known of the two. These works were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity for their large scale and the prominence of a nude female figure.

The painting has been widely analyzed by art historians, with themes including the emulation of ancient painters, the context of wedding celebrations, and the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism. However, most agree that the main meaning of the painting is a straightforward and accessible treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, focusing on sensory appeal.

In the center, Venus stands nude in a giant scallop shell, a motif found in classical depictions of her birth. To the left, the wind god Zephyrus blows her toward the shore, accompanied by a female figure, likely Aura, the personification of a lighter breeze. Both are shown with wings, and their combined efforts blow Venus and the surrounding roses toward land.

On the right, a female figure, one of the Horae (goddesses of the seasons), holds out a cloak to cover Venus as she arrives. The floral decoration of her dress suggests she is the Hora of Spring. She stands in a relaxed, joyful pose, welcoming Venus.

Alternative interpretations suggest the secondary female figures may be Chloris and Flora, characters also found in Primavera. The subject of the painting is not strictly the "birth" of Venus, but rather her arrival on land, likely representing either Cythera or Cyprus, both islands associated with Venus in Greek mythology.

          "Tronie of a girl with a pearl earring — serene and mysterious.",
      "artworkDetails": """
Girl with a Pearl Earring is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, dated around 1665. Over the centuries, the painting has been known by various names, but it became widely recognized by its current title towards the end of the 20th century because of the prominent earring worn by the girl in the portrait. The work has been part of the Mauritshuis collection in The Hague since 1902 and has inspired numerous literary and cinematic adaptations.

The painting is a tronie, a Dutch 17th-century term for a study of a head that was not intended as a formal portrait. It depicts a European girl dressed in "exotic" clothing, including an "oriental" turban and a large, striking earring. The identity of the subject remains unknown; she may have been a real model or a more generalized and mysterious figure, possibly representing a Sibyl or a biblical character. Some have speculated that she was Vermeer's eldest daughter, Maria, but this theory is considered unlikely by many art historians.

The painting is executed in oil on canvas and measures 44.5 cm high by 39 cm wide. It is signed "IVMeer" but not dated, and is estimated to have been painted around 1665.

A restoration in 1994 enhanced the subtle color scheme and the intimacy of the girl's gaze. During this process, it was discovered that the background, now appearing somewhat mottled and dark, was originally a deep enamel-like green created by a thin transparent glaze over a black base. Over time, the organic pigments in the glaze have faded. In 2014, Dutch astrophysicist Vincent Icke suggested that the earring may actually be made of polished tin rather than pearl, based on its reflective qualities, shape, and size.

The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh, created in June 1889. It depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. The painting has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941 and is regarded as one of the most recognizable and celebrated paintings in Western art.

Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum, where he admitted himself following a mental health crisis in December 1888. The asylum, housed in a former monastery, allowed Van Gogh access to both a second-story bedroom and a ground-floor studio. During his year-long stay, he produced many notable works, including Irises, a self-portrait, and The Starry Night.

The painting features swirling celestial elements, including Venus, which was visible at the time, and an exaggerated crescent moon. The cypress trees in the foreground are depicted on a larger scale than in Van Gogh's other works, and the village is an imaginary addition based on sketches rather than the actual landscape. Van Gogh's letters suggest he viewed the cypress trees primarily in aesthetic terms.

The Starry Night has inspired a wide range of interpretations, from religious symbolism to reflections of Van Gogh’s emotional state. Some art historians connect the swirling sky to contemporary astronomical discoveries, while others see it as an expression of the artist’s inner turmoil. Van Gogh himself was critical of the painting, referring to it as a "failure" in letters to his brother, Theo.

After Van Gogh's death, the painting passed through several owners before being acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1941. Scientific analysis has confirmed Van Gogh’s use of ultramarine and cobalt blue for the sky, with Indian yellow and zinc yellow for the stars and moon. The Starry Night remains a touchstone of modern art and a testament to Van Gogh’s unique vision.

Water Lilies (French: Nymphéas) is a series of approximately 250 oil paintings by French Impressionist Claude Monet, created between 1897 and 1926. These paintings depict the artist's flower garden at his home in Giverny and became the main focus of his artistic production during the last 31 years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts.

Monet's approach of producing and exhibiting series of paintings related by subject and perspective began in 1889, with earlier series such as the Haystacks. The Water Lilies series is among his most celebrated, capturing the changing light, reflections, and atmosphere of his garden's pond.

In the 1920s, France built a pair of oval rooms at the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris as a permanent home for eight large water lily murals by Monet. The exhibit opened to the public in May 1927, shortly after Monet's death. Today, Water Lilies paintings are displayed in major museums around the world, including the Musée Marmottan Monet, the Musée d'Orsay, the Tate, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and many others. The series remains a defining achievement of Impressionism and a testament to Monet's fascination with light, color, and nature.

      "description": "Distorted scream under red sky — anxiety personified.",
      "artworkDetails": """
The Scream is an art composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik ("Scream"), and the German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur ("The Scream of Nature"). The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.

Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun's light turned the clouds "a blood red". He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". Scholars have located the spot along a fjord path overlooking Oslo and have suggested various explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister's commitment at a nearby asylum.

Munch created two versions in paint and two in pastels, as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints survive. Both painted versions have been stolen from public museums, but since recovered. In 2012, one of the pastel versions commanded the highest nominal price paid for an artwork at a public auction at that time.

Sources of inspiration:
In his diary, Munch wrote about his experience: "One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord – the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked. This became The Scream."

He later described his inspiration for the image: "I was walking along the road with two friends – the sun was setting – suddenly the sky turned blood red – I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the fence – there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the city – my friends walked on, and I stood there trembling with anxiety – and I sensed an infinite scream passing through nature."

Some scholars believe, based on these accounts, that Munch was describing a terrifying emotional experience that would today be called a panic attack.

      "description": "Melting clocks in a surreal landscape.",
      "artworkDetails": """
The Persistence of Memory (Catalan: La persistència de la memòria, Spanish: La persistencia de la memoria) is a 1931 painting by Salvador Dalí and one of the most recognizable works of Surrealism. First exhibited at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, the painting has been in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City since 1934. It is widely recognized and frequently referenced in popular culture, and is sometimes called "The Melting Clocks," "The Soft Watches," or "The Melting Watches."

The painting introduced the image of the soft, melting pocket watch, epitomizing Dalí's theory of "softness" and "hardness," which was central to his thinking at the time. The soft watches are often interpreted as a symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of fixed cosmic order. While some have suggested a connection to Einstein's theory of relativity, Dalí himself said the inspiration came from the surrealist perception of a Camembert cheese melting in the sun.

The year before creating The Persistence of Memory, Dalí developed his "paranoiac-critical method," deliberately inducing hallucinatory states to inspire his art. He famously remarked, "The difference between a madman and me is that I am not mad," highlighting his awareness and control over his creative process.

At the center of the composition is a strange, dreamlike "monster" form, which Dalí used in several works as a kind of self-portrait. The creature, with its closed eye and long eyelashes, appears to be in a dream state, and its ambiguous form is typical of figures that appear in dreams. The clocks may symbolize the passing or persistence of time as experienced in dreams.

The orange watch at the bottom left is covered in ants, a recurring symbol of decay in Dalí's work. A fly sits on another watch, casting a human-like shadow. The painting uses highly realistic techniques to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking life.

The rocky landscape in the background represents the tip of Cap de Creus in north-eastern Catalonia, a region that inspired many of Dalí's paintings. The shadow in the foreground is a reference to Puig Pení, a mountain in the same area.
